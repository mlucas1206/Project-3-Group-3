# Samples Organization

1. PySample.py - The Python Program that performs three main operations:
    Load CSV into a database table.
    Clean, organize, select data.
    Export data to a better format to produce tables and graphs in a WEB APP.
2. HTML and app.js - the components of the web application with one table and one graph.

These are only examples, but can be used with proper adjustments to complete our project.
